1. Random SEED does not get refreshed everytime generate_salt is called, resulting in everytime, the random number is the same.
2. Since the sql query uses raw input from user's card's data, user can inject commands to UNION admin's hashed password with card_id, and display it on use.html.
3. requests.get("director",None) is very risky because if I use URL <original URL>?director=<my script> would breach into the website and run my script.
4. For CSRF attack, since the server does not check CSRF token, I am able to use another HTML and post a form that contains amount and username and send cards into my account.
